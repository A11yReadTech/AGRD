                            Preamble

The development of software and specific specifications relating to important factors in design particularly those relating to accessibility and readability, is a complicated, nuanced, and challenging journey.

To encourage the development and continue testing and research, this public license was developed. The intention is to allow the non-commercial use and experimentation with the concepts specifications and code related to this and other projects herein, but to restrict the ill-advised use in inappropriate situations, and to restrict the modification of code or specifications for commercial work or for applications that rightly require special consideration such as medical, clinical, transportation, aerospace, automotive, military, and any place where human safety is a considered factor.

Therefore, the code and specifications in this repository are limited to experimental non-commercial work, research work, and academic work, with the understanding that this license may be revoked at any time when it is deemed necessary by the organization, in order to ensure public health or safety, or to eliminate misunderstandings relating to the intellectual property contained within this repo and related repositories.

In short this means:
- You may use the materials in this repository for your own use and purposes, including the internal use or purposes for your organization.
- You may submit issues comments import requests herein to discuss or provide alternate versions for consideration.
- You may use the materials here in for noncommercial tools, or products which are available on a non-commercial basis provided that:
    - The substance of the specifications not changed other than as may be needed for translation, porting, encapsulation, summarizing, or organizing.
    - Indications made of any such changes, with a link to the canonical references in this repository or in the officially published work.
    - Until further notice, and then all usage of this work shall contain the statement that it is part of public better, is it work in progress, and subject to change.
    - Under no circumstances may any work in this repository be referred to as approved, recommended, normative, or as a regulation with any actual legal weight, without the written permission or discussion of the maintainers of this repository.
    - Under no circumstances may any work in this depository be offered for sale, nor shall it be offered with any warranty express or implied.
