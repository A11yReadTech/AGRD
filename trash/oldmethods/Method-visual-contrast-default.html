<!--
Code for the tabbed interface for this W3C Silver Prototype was lovingly ripped from https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/ with the example code taken from https://codepen.io/heydon/pen/veeaEa .

All credit for this goes to Heydon Pickering https://twitter.com/heydonworks.
You should totally buy his book on Inclusive Components.

<h2>Basics</h2>
<h3>Status</h3>
<ul>
<li>Last Updated date
<li>20 January 2020. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G148.html">WCAG 2.1 Technique G148</a>. Minor adaptation for Silver structure.  
</ul> 
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Web
</p>
<h3>Programming Language</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML - all versions
<li>Any web technology where text and background color are specified separately and browsers can control default colors. 
</ul>
<h3>How It Solves User Need</h3>
<p>The objective of this method is to make sure that users can read text that is presented over a background. With this method the author avoids having to do any contrast measures by simply not specifying the text color and not specifying the background. As a result the colors of both are completely determined by the user agent.
</p>
<p>
Some people who have vision disabilities set their user agent to override certain colors that they have trouble seeing. This method will help avoid a situation where the user agent and web site conflict with each other over the foreground and/or background colors resulting in the same color for text and background, which would make it invisible for user who set their own colors in their browser or Assistive Technology.

<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
<p>The author specifies neither text color nor background, and does not use CSS. As a result the user can set his browser defaults to provide the colors and contrasts that work well for them. 
</p>
<h3>Related Methods</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select font characteristics and background colors to provide enough contrast
</ul>
</section>

<section id="section3">
<h2>Code Samples</h2>
<p>None. No HTML or CSS font or color styles are set. 
</p>
</section>

<section id="section4">
<h2>Tests</h2>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Look in all places that text color can be specified
    <li>Check that text color is not specified
    <li>Look in all areas that background color or image used as a background can be specified
    <li>Check that no background color or image used as a background is specified
</ol>
<h3>Expected Results</h3>
<ul>
    <li># 2 and 4 are true
</ul>
