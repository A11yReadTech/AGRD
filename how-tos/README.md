# APCA Guidelines How-To

How-tos are created for every guideline, stored in this directory, with one sub-directory per how-to, with a set of standard simple HTML files.

## Creating a New How-To

To create a new how-to, copy the template directory and its contents within this directory. Name the folder per to the short name of the guideline, lowercasing the name and replacing all punctuation, including whitespace, with hyphens. For example, "Visual Contrast" becomes "visual-contrast".

## How-To Content

Each file in the how-to contains particular content.

### index.html

### get-started.html

### plan.html

### design.html

### develop.html

### examples.html

### resources.html

## Other Resources in How-Tos

You may add resources to how-tos, such as images, stylesheets, scripts, and examples. Create sub-directories for each type of resource you add: "img" for images, "css" for stylesheets, "js" for javascript, "examples" for examples. Use relative links to any resource that is part of the how-to.
