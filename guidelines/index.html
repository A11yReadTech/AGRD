			<p>The APCA Readability Guidelines (APRG) provide a range of recommendations for making visual content on illuminated displays more accessible to all users, especially with visual impairments.
			
			Following these guidelines will address many of the needs of users with low vision, color vision deficiency, and other visual impairments; certain cognitive and learning disabilities; and combinations of these. These guidelines address visual accessibility of digital content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other web of things devices. The guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
			<p>This specification is expected to be updated regularly to keep pace with changing technology by updating and adding methods, outcomes, and guidelines to address new needs as technologies evolve. For entities that make formal claims of <a>conformance</a> to these guidelines, several levels of conformance are available to address the diverse nature of digital content and the type of testing that is performed.</p>
			<p>Accessible Perceptual Readability Guidelines (APRG) are developed to augment W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3 [WCAG3] and intended to eventually integrate with these other standards. APRG includes additional tests and different scoring mechanisms than sed previously. As a result, APRG is not backwards compatible with WCAG 2.x. APRG is an alternative set of guidelines.</p>

				<h3>About APCA Readability Guidelines </h3>
				<p>This introduction provides a <em>brief</em> background to APCA and APRG. </p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Section status levels</h3>
				<p>As part of the drafting process each normative section of this document is given a status, approximately following WCAG 3. This status is used to indicate how far along in the development this section is.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong id="status-deprecated">Deprecated</strong>: This content is obsolete, and no longer supported <em>hidden by default</em>.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-placeholder">Placeholder</strong>: This content is temporary, it showcases the type of content or section to expect here <em>hidden by default</em>.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-exploratory">Exploratory</strong>: This content is not refined, details and definitions may be missing  <em>hidden by default</em>.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-developing">Developing</strong>: There is rough agreement but not all high-level concerns have been settled. Details have been filled, but are yet to be worked out. </li>
					<li><strong id="status-refining">Refining</strong>: It is ready for broad public review and experimental adoption. </li>
					<li><strong id="status-mature">Mature</strong>: Content is believed to be ready for integration with other standards.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Goals and Requirements</h3>
				<p>The goal of APRG and supporting documents is to make digital products including web, ePub, PDF, applications, mobile apps, and other emerging technologies more readable, accessible and usable to all people, including those with disabilities. this goal will be met through evidence based science and responding to changing technologies.</p>

				<p>Research and development work performed by Myndex Research identified issues with the existing WCAG 2.X contrast metrics. These issues shaped the guidelines that follow.</p>

			<h2>Normative requirements</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>There are two types of content in this document:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Normative:</strong> what you must do to meet the guidelines.</li>
				<li><strong>Non-normative:</strong> advice to help you meet the guidelines. This is also called <q>Informative</q>.</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			<p>In addition to this section, the <a href="#guidelines">Guidelines</a>, <a href="#testing">Testing</a>, and <a href="#conformance">Conformance</a> sections in APCA provide <a>normative</a> content and define requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as <q>non-normative</q>, diagrams, examples, and notes are <a>informative</a> (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.</p>
			<p>The key words <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST NOT">MUST NOT</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="NOT RECOMMENDED">NOT RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="RECOMMENDED">RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em>, and <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD NOT">SHOULD NOT</em> are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119]].</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Sensory - Vision &amp; Visual </li>
						</ul>
					</details>
				<div class="ednote">
					<p>Visual Contrast is a paradigm shift from WCAG 2.1n terms of methodology and scope:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>New contrast calculations based on modern research on visual perception, providing a perceptally uniform result</li>
						<li>Merging the 1.4.x criteria into one guideline.</li>
						<li>New tests for text and non-text contrast.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>This is a significant change from <q>Contrast (Minimum)</q> and <q>Contrast (Enhanced)</q>. The reason for this change is that the understanding of contrast has matured and the available research and body of knowledge has made breakthroughs in advancing the understanding of <q>visual contrast</q>.</p>
				<p>The proposed new guidance more accurately models current research in human visual perception of contrast and light intensity. The goal is to improve understanding of the functional needs of all users, and more effectively match the needs of those who face barriers accessing content. This new perception-based model is more context dependent than a strict light ratio measurement; results can, for example, vary with size of text and the darkness of the colors or background.</p>
				<p>This model is more responsive to user needs and allows designers more choice in visual presentation. It does this by including multi-factor assessment tests which integrate contrast with inter-related elements of visual readability, such as font features. It includes tests to determine an upper limit of contrast, where elevated contrast may impact usability.</p>

			<h2>Conformance</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>To assert that your content or product meets an APCA outcome is called “conformance.” To conform to APCA, your test results must show that your project is visually accessible.</p>
				<p>If you want to make a formal claim of conformance, you must use the processes described in this document. Even if you don't want t make a claim, this document and processes can help you improve the visual accessibility for all sighted users.</p>	
			</details>
			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Conformance levels</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
				<p>APCA uses a new conformance model modeled after, and following the developments of WCAG 3.0, in order to support the goal of eventual integration. Some key goals for this new conformance model:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Develop a model that encourages websites to improve accessibility, as opposed to stopping at an arbitrary level such as "AA";</li>
					<li>Better reflect the needs of visual users of content, and the wide spectrum of human vision and vision & language related impairments.</li>
					<li>Emphasize the need for discrete use cases based on the importance of the specific element understanding the content.
					<li>Recognize the natural divisions of technology vs. content</li>
				</ol>

				<p>To do this, the conformance model prioritizes content needed to complete tasks while still considering the entire view for readability and accessibility. This means that sites may conform at the lowest level (Bronze), while still containing a small amount of content that does not meet one or more guidelines, so long as that content doesn’t prevent people with disabilities from successfully using the site.</p>

				</div>
				<p>APRG defines three levels of conformance: <a href="#bronze">bronze</a>, <a href="#silver">silver</a>, and <a href="#gold">gold</a>.</p>

				<section>
					<h4>Bronze</h4>
					<p>Bronze is the minimum conformance level. Content that does not meet the requirements of the bronze level does not conform to APRG. While there is some overlap between WCAG 2.x and APRG, APRG includes additional tests and different scoring methods. As a result, APRG is not backwards compatible with WCAG 2.x.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Silver</h4>
					<p>Silver is a higher conformance level, featuring improved readability and accommodation of user preferences.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Gold</h4>
					<p>Gold is the highest conformance level, featuring the improvements from Silver, but adding tests to ensure consistent presentation, such as regulating font x-height and weight relative to defined reference fonts.</p>
				</section>
			</section>


			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Defining conformance scope</h3>
				<p>When evaluating the accessibility of content, APRG requires the outcomes apply to a specific scope. While the scope can be all content within a digital product, it is usually one or more sub-sets of the whole. Reasons for this include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Large amounts of content are impractical to evaluate comprehensively using anything beyond <a>automated evaluation</a> of atomic tests;</li>
					<li>Dynamic content changes frequently, so evaluation needs to be consider the range of variation, and examine the underlying styles;</li>
					<li>Some content is more important to the majority of users than other content; and</li>
				</ul>
				<p>APRG therefore defines two inter-related ways to scope content: <a>views</a> and <a>structure</a>. Evaluation and conformance is done on one or more complete views or structures. </p>


			</section>


			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Conformance requirements</h3>
				<p>In order for technology to <a>conform</a> to APRG, the following conformance requirements apply:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Conformance level</b> - Content MUST meet the requirements of the selected <a href="#conformance-levels">conformance level</a>.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Conformance claims</h3>
				<p>Conformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to APRG without making a claim. The material below describes how to make a conformance claim if that option is chosen.</p>
				<section><h4>Required components of a conformance claim</h4><p>A conformance claim MUST include the following information:</p><ol>
						<li><b>Date</b> of the claim;</li>
						<li><b>Guidelines title, version and URI</b>
							<q>W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 at ???</q></li>
						<li><b>Conformance level</b> satisfied: (bronze, silver, or gold);</li>
						<li><b>A concise description of the views and processes</b>, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including any state changes which lead to a new view; and</li>
						<li>The technology including the hardware, software, and assistive technology used to test the claim.</li>
